# APOD Rust Client

## Introduction

To learn and practice writing code in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), I've decided to write a small Rust wrapper for the [NASA APOD API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).

Will expand on the README as the project progresses, but Rust also provides commands for generating documentation. When (if) I publish this crate, I can provide a link to the doc.
